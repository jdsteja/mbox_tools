Hi Anish,
So am I getting something wrong here? You said "I have created a search
index on book Id , title ,and author from a database of books which fall
under various categories." so those are 3 fields, right?
1. How do you filter the doc types (as in the genres) at search time? Do you
even need to do that, if yes how?
2. If you're doing that 'm assuming you're already indexing the genre
somehow. Right?
3. How about a field for the genre having multi-valued entries (multiple
field objects going into the same doc with the same field label). This would
help you store 1 doc as 1 doc having multiple genres instead of duplicate
entries.

I'm still not sure if I've gotten tre problem correctly, but hope this is of
help!
