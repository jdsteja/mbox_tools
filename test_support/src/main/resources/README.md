Contains test resource files shared by modules.

- `mbox` contains raw mbox messages
- `json` contains json files, typically they represent correctly converted mbox message

## Important !!!

Before you add a new resource file, make sure that it does not contain any sensitive information, for example
**IP addresses** and **DNS names** to avoid security risks.
