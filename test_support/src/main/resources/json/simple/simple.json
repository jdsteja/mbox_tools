We\n&gt;&gt;&gt; have everything we had in jboss cache working, it's a dumb down but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; higher level framework, with stuff like Fault Tolerant timers, which\n&gt;&gt;&gt; is then reuse in whole Mobicents platform to provide cluster related\n&gt;&gt;&gt; features. I believe we now already use a lot of stuff from Infinispan\n&gt;&gt;&gt; rich feature set, so I guess it's good timing to give some feedback,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; report some minor issues, and clear some doubts.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Marshallers\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it's negative stuff at all. On the contrary, I think it's really valuable feedback from another Infinispan user :)\n&gt;\n&gt; I don't think it's negative also, but some could interpret like that,\n&gt; you know, too many complaints, whatever ;-)\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; AS7 will of course have Infinispan but in due course.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So right now, there is no work being done to plug Infinispan in AS7?\n\nI can't say 100% for sure, Paul Ferraro or Scott Marlow will be able to clarify this further, but AFAIK, this is not being done yet.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Eduardo\n&gt; ..............................................\n&gt; http://emmartins.blogspot.com\n&gt; http://redhat.com/solutions/telco\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; infinispan-dev mailing list\n&gt; infinispan-dev@lists.jboss.org\n&gt; https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/infinispan-dev\n\n--\nGalder ZamarreÃ±o\nSr. Software Engineer\nInfinispan, JBoss Cache\n\n\n\n",
