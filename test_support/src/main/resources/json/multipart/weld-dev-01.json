But there's a difference in \n> what happens next:\n>\n>   * In the non-ejb version, the bridge method then immediately invokes\n>     doSomething(String) and only then is the proxy's method handler\n>     invoked. The handler is therefore dealing with the method\n>     doSomething(*String*)\n>   * in the EJB version, doSomething(Object) is not a bridge method,\n>     and so the method handler is invoked directly and it (the handler)\n>     is operating on doSomething(*Object*).\n>\n> In the second case, this ultimately means that Weld will check whether \n> doSomething(Object) is intercepted. It isn't, since \n> Beans.getInterceptableMethods() is ignoring bridge methods. The \n> interceptor will not be invoked. On the other hand, in the first case, \n> the interceptor _will_ be invoked, since Weld will be checking whether \n> doSomething(String) is intercepted.\n>\n> My initial solution was to make Beans.getInterceptableMethods() also \n> return bridge methods, but now I'm thinking the actual problem is in \n> the proxy itself. IMO, when creating a proxy based on an interface, we \n> should also generate bridge methods on the proxy (this should be \n> either done by Weld or by Javassist directly). These bridge methods \n> should be perfectly normal bridge methods and should not invoke the \n> method handler directly. They should simply invoke the non-bridge \n> method and the non-bridge method should then invoke the method handler.\n>\n> The java compiler can't add bridge methods directly to interfaces \n> which require them, so it adds them to all the classes implementing \n> the interface (StringFooImpl in our case). Since we are creating \n> StringFoo$Proxy, which is also a class implementing an interface which \n> requires bridge methods, we should add the bridge methods\n> to it - exactly as the java compiler would.\n>\n> This would solve the interceptor problem and possibly other similar \n> problems as well.\n>\n> What do you think?\n>\n> Marko\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> weld-dev mailing list\n> weld-dev@lists.jboss.org\n> https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/weld-dev\n",
