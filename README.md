# "mbox" Integration

Collection of tools that can be used to:

1. parse mbox files and turn them into JSON objects
2. enhance or override JSON objects with custom metadata
3. send JSON object via HTTP

We use these tools to parse mbox files and archives from services like <https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo>, we add specific metadata to each JSON and, finally, we send resulting JSON objects to correctly configured Searchisko for indexing.

The code has been tailored specifically for Searchisko API but generally it shouldn't be hard to use these tools in connection with other JSON service/servers, like Elasticsearch, MongoDB, â€¦ etc.

## How to use it

Get the code and build it (Java 1.7 required):

    git clone https://github.com/searchisko/mbox_integration;
    cd mbox_integration;
    mvn clean package;
    
Get some mbox files:

    --TBD--
    
Given Searchisko is properly configured and running at `http:localhost:8080` you can parse and send mbox data to it using the following approach:

    --TBD--

## More about "mbox" format

mbox ([RFC 4155](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4155)) stores mailbox messages in their original
Internet Message ([RFC 2822](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822)) format, usually in files directly accessible to users.
